# Movie-Recommendation-System
A Console application for movie recommendation system build using content based and collaborative filtering.

You can get the dataset which i had used in my application from the rar file i.e recommendersys uploaded here or you can download the dataset which i had used from https://www.kaggle.com/code/rounakbanik/movie-recommender-systems/data


The content based:-The implementation of this model is extremely trivial. All we have to do is sort our movies based on ratings and popularity and display the top movies of our list. As an added step, we can pass in a genre argument to get the top movies of a particular genre.

Collaborative Filtering:-Collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B.
